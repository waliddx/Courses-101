## Getting Started

Welcome to Python 101! This course is designed to teach you the fundamentals of Python programming from scratch. Whether you're a beginner or have some programming experience, this course will help you build a strong foundation in Python.

By the end of this course, you will:

So, let's get started and embark on this exciting journey of learning Python!

## Course Curriculum

By the end of this course, you will:

- Understand the basic syntax and data types in Python
- Learn how to write and execute Python programs
- Explore control flow statements such as if-else, loops, and functions
- Work with data structures like lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets
- Gain knowledge of file handling and exception handling in Python
- Get hands-on experience with Python libraries and modules

## Prerequisites

- No prior programming experience is required
- Basic understanding of computer concepts and terminology is helpful

## Installation

To install Python and any additional libraries or dependencies required for this course, follow these steps:

1. **Windows**: 
    - Visit the official Python website at [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/) and download the latest version of Python for Windows.
    - Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.
    - Make sure to check the box that says "Add Python to PATH" during the installation process.

    **macOS**:
    - Visit the official Python website at [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/mac-osx/) and download the latest version of Python for macOS.
    - Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions to complete the installation.

    **Linux**:
    - Python is usually pre-installed on most Linux distributions. You can check if Python is already installed by opening a terminal and running the command `python --version`. If Python is not installed, you can install it using your package manager. For example, on Ubuntu, you can run `sudo apt-get install python3` to install Python 3.

2. After installing Python, you can verify the installation by opening a terminal or command prompt and running the command `python --version`. This should display the version of Python installed on your system.

3. Optionally, you may want to set up a virtual environment for this course. A virtual environment allows you to create an isolated Python environment with its own packages and dependencies. To set up a virtual environment, you can use the `venv` module that comes with Python. Here's how you can create a virtual environment:

    - Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you want to create the virtual environment.
    - Run the command `python -m venv myenv` to create a new virtual environment named "myenv". Replace "myenv" with the desired name for your virtual environment.
    - Activate the virtual environment by running the command `source myenv/bin/activate` on macOS/Linux or `myenv\Scripts\activate` on Windows.

    Once the virtual environment is activated, any packages or dependencies you install will be isolated to that environment.

4. You're now ready to start learning Python! You can proceed to the [Usage](#usage) section to learn how to navigate the course materials and resources.
